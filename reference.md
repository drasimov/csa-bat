More tips on writing quality trash code

### Tip 1——Use complicated structures
Trashing yourself is simple and easy. Get yourself distracted, addicted to your phone, not willing to work, and forcing yourself to work makes the best Trash conditions of yourself.

### Presequites to Trash your Code
Here are the basic requirements to Trash your Code.

1. Open your least favorite text-editor, with completely no code-highlight or code auto-complete. The default Windows text-editor or the macOS default text-editor would be a good choice.
2. Open a random music application on your phone, computer or whatever device. Play music that you don't like. A good one would be Lost Rivers.
3. Play the music at full volume with either speakers or headphones. Shake your head so you get into action.
4. Use your keyboard horizontally, and switch to your other hand using the mouse. This makes you feel good about yourself.
5. Create a file supports less encodings and characters. ANSI files would in nice.
6. Start writing trash code!

### Writing the Code
After you have done the things done above, you are ready to write Trash Code!

**Remember, the first thing writing trash code is to be complicated.**

Let's say that you are writing a program that receives the input as the radius and outputs the perimeter and area.

**ALL CODE SEGMENTS ARE WRITTEN IN JAVA, USE YOUR CLEVER BRAIN TO CHANGE IT TO THE LANGUAGE YOU WRITE, THAT MAKES IT EVEN TRASH. **

1. First thing you have to do is to declare the base class and method of your code. Let's first rename our file by a wrong spelling name which starts with lower cases(so that we will not be able to recognize them from methods). Since the file name was changed, let's change our class name, too.
```
public class area{
    public static void main(String[] args){

    }
}
```

2. Declare the variables you need with meaningless variable names, or write meaningful variable names and assign them with the wrong values.
```
public class area{
    public static void main(String[] args){
          Double i =  888.0;
          Double e = 666.0;

          Double radius = 2 * 3.14 *
    }
}
```

3. Write equations for computing the area and perimeter and put set them to other variables.
```
public class Area{
    public static void main(String[] args){
          Double i =  888.0;
          Double e = 666.0;

          Double radius = 2 * 3.14 * i;
          Double perimeter = 3.14 * i * i;
    }
}
```
4. Print random stuff out!
```
public class Area{
    public static void main(String[] args){
          Double i =  888.0;
          Double e = 666.0;

          Double radius = 2 * 3.14 * i;
          Double perimeter = 3.14 * i * i;

          System.out.println(i);
          System.out.println(e);
          System.out.println(i);
          System.out.println(perimeter);
    }
}
```
5. Oh Yeah! What messy code!
